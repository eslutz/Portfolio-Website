An additional workflow could be called to package and publish a library NuGet package to NuGet.org.<br />The shared workflow can be called by copying the pre-made workflow files from the <strong><code>Generic Workflows</code></strong> folder into the target repos. These workflows, when triggered, would call the workflow files in the specified repo. They were written so that the unit test and static analysis workflows would run for any new pull request or updates to a pull request in the calling repo. The workflow to package and publish a NuGet file would be run any time a new release is created in the calling repo.",
